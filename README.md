# k-means-clustering-on-satellite-image-data-
k-means clustering from scratch

In this project, we implement the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch to group data points into clusters.

## Overview

K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering tasks. It aims to partition data points into K clusters based on their features.

## Dataset

We utilized a satellite image dataset for clustering analysis. The dataset is included in this repository but can be easily substituted with your own dataset.

## Implementation

Our implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm is provided in the Jupyter Notebook `kmeans_clustering.ipynb`. This notebook contains the code for initializing centroids, assigning data points to clusters, updating centroids, and visualizing the clusters.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for clustering analysis.
- `kmeans_band_image_tuhin_patra_version_no_1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm.
